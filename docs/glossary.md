# Glossary of Terms for CE1 Virtual Machine

This glossary defines key terms related to the CE1 virtual machine framework, which integrates concepts from complex analysis, signal processing, and information theory to enable reversible operations and efficient data manipulation on 64-bit data and multimodal signals.

---

## Core Concepts

#### **CE1 VM**
A virtual machine framework that uses concepts from complex analysis, information theory, and reversible computing. It operates on 64-bit data and includes components like mirrors, kernels, boundary policies, and a planner for optimizing operations based on minimum description length (MDL).

#### **Analytic Continuation**
A technique in complex analysis to extend the domain of a complex function beyond its initial region of definition. In the CE1 VM, this is analogized to choosing boundary conditions for data types (e.g., integers, floats), where different continuations represent different interpretations of data at boundaries.

#### **Boundary Conditions**
Policies that define how data behaves at the edges or boundaries of its domain. For example, in signal processing, boundary conditions determine how signals are padded beyond known values. In CE1, boundary conditions are typed and applied to ports/heaps (e.g., `int64.boundary` or `float64.boundary`).

#### **MDL (Minimum Description Length)**
A principle from information theory that measures the complexity of data representation, often using compression algorithms like zstd. In CE1, the planner minimizes MDL to choose efficient boundary policies and kernels.

#### **zstd**
A fast, lossless compression algorithm (Zstandard) used throughout the CE1 system for measuring data complexity and implementing MDL scoring. Unlike deflate (used in gzip), zstd offers better compression ratios and faster decompression speeds, making it ideal for real-time applications. The compressed size of data serves as a proxy for its description length, with smaller compressed sizes indicating more efficient representations.

#### **Energy**
In CE1, energy is defined as `Œîzstd(u64) + invariant_bonus - boundary_move_cost`, where:
- `Œîzstd(u64)` is the change in zstd compression size of the data after operation
- `invariant_bonus` is a reward for satisfying invariants
- `boundary_move_cost` is a cost for changing boundary policies or branch cuts

## Data Structures

#### **Heap and Stack**
Memory structures in the CE1 VM:
- **Heap**: Stores raw data as content IDs (CIDs)
- **Stack**: Stores Merkle DAGs (directed acyclic graphs) with sheet information for tracking branches and transformations

#### **Riemann Surface**
A surface that represents a multi-valued complex function by connecting its different branches (sheets). In CE1, sheet bookkeeping tracks these branches during operations, and branch cuts can be moved via BranchCutMove.

#### **Sheet Bookkeeping**
The process of tracking different sheets (branches) of multi-valued functions during operations. This involves annotating sheet IDs and managing deck transformations when branches are merged or moved.

## Operations and Kernels

#### **Mirror (Œ†)**
In CE1, mirrors are reversible operations or transformations that can be applied to data without loss of information. They are part of the kernel set and include operations like bit casting with boundary policies.

#### **bit_cast**
An operation that reinterprets the bits of data from one type to another (e.g., from `u64` to `f64`), often with explicit boundary policies (e.g., endianness).

#### **M_if**
A function in CE1 that performs bit casting of 64-bit data with boundary policies, such as endianness canonicalization.

#### **Convolution (Œ£)**
A mathematical operation that combines two functions to produce a third function. In CE1, convolution is performed with explicit boundary policies (e.g., via AnalyticPad) to ensure reversibility or minimize artifacts.

#### **K***
A set of continuation kernels in CE1, including:
- `HilbertLift[Œí=...]`
- `KKpair[Œí=...]`
- `SchwarzReflect[Œí=Œì]`
- `EdgeOfWedge[Œí=overlap]`
- `BranchCutMove[Œ≥‚ÜíŒ≥‚Ä≤]`

## Specialized Kernels

#### **HilbertLift**
A kernel that converts a real-valued signal to an analytic signal using the Hilbert transform (via FFT and phase flipping). It is reversible on band-limited windows with declared padding boundaries (e.g., periodic or mirror pad).

#### **K-K Pair**
Refers to Kramers-Kronig relations, which connect the real and imaginary parts of causal functions in the frequency domain. This kernel is used for analytic continuation in causal systems and requires a boundary policy of "causal in the upper half-plane."

#### **SchwarzReflect**
A kernel that reflects an analytic function across a boundary curve Œì using the Schwarz reflection principle. It requires that the function satisfies `f(zÃÑ) = \overline{f(z)}` on the mirror line, which is enforced as an invariant.

#### **Edge-of-Wedge**
A kernel based on the edge-of-wedge theorem, which allows two analytic functions from different wedges (or half-planes) to be merged if they agree on an overlap region. This enables branch collapse and simplifies representations.

#### **BranchCutMove**
A kernel that changes the branch cut of a multi-valued complex function (e.g., logarithm or square root). It involves homotopy (continuous deformation) of the cut path and tracks monodromy (deck transformations) in the stack. This allows for reversible changes in function branches.

#### **M√∂biusFlip**
A kernel that performs non-orientable state transport by flipping the handedness of states while preserving analyticity. Unlike orientable kernels (BranchCutMove, SchwarzReflect), M√∂biusFlip introduces topological twist, enabling the planner to cross orientation boundaries and explore qualitatively different solution spaces. Incurs a "twist cost" (œá) in energy accounting and requires Orientation Consistency invariant checking to ensure the flipped state can be re-embedded without topological tearing.

## Boundary Policies

#### **AnalyticPad**
A padding method used before operations like FFT or convolution to maintain analyticity or reduce edge artifacts. Options include periodic padding, mirror padding, or anti-periodic padding. The choice of padding is a boundary policy that affects data continuity.

#### **Typed Boundary Policies**
Specific boundary policies applied to different data types in CE1. For example:
- `int64.boundary`: options include `twos_complement`, `saturate`, `wrapmod(2^k)`
- `float64.boundary`: options include `reflect`, `periodic`, `antiperiodic`, `causal`, `analytic_sheet(id)`, `branch_cut(Œ≥)`
- `signal.boundary`: options include `periodize`, `mirror_pad`, `zero_pad`, `min_phase`

#### **Two's-complement**
A boundary convention for representing signed integers in binary, where the most significant bit indicates the sign. In CE1, this is one of several boundary policies for `int64.boundary`, along with options like saturate or wrapmod.

## Invariants and Consistency

#### **Invariants (I)**
Conditions that must be satisfied during operations to ensure correctness. In CE1, these include CR residual, reflection law, dispersion consistency, and sheet bookkeeping. Violations incur penalties in the energy accounting.

#### **CR Residual**
The residual from the Cauchy-Riemann equations, which must be zero for a function to be analytic. In CE1, this is an invariant enforced during operations to ensure analyticity. It is computed as `‚Äñ‚àÇf/‚àÇx ‚àí i‚àÇf/‚àÇy‚Äñ¬≤` within a declared analytic region.

#### **Dispersion Consistency**
A consistency check between the real and imaginary parts of a causal function using Kramers-Kronig relations. In CE1, this invariant ensures that signals satisfy Hilbert transform pairs within a tolerance, which is crucial for causal signal processing.

## Planning and Optimization

#### **Planner**
A component in the CE1 VM that chooses the best combination of kernels and boundary policies to minimize MDL and respect invariants. It searches for paths that reduce description length while maintaining analyticity and other constraints.

#### **Energy Accounting**
A method to measure the cost or benefit of operations in terms of MDL change. It includes `Œîzstd(u64)` (change in compression size), bonuses for satisfying invariants, and costs for moving boundary policies or branch cuts. Used by the planner to make decisions.

## QL-Metric Terms

The metanion basis consists of basis states `|x‚ü©` for `x ‚àà ùîΩ‚ÇÇ‚Çà` (the finite field with 2^8 = 256 elements), providing a complete orthonormal basis for the 256-dimensional state space. Topologically modeled as a torus‚Äîa closed, orientable surface that guarantees stable recurrence and bounded neutrality, perfectly suited as a neutral buffer with circulation and return paths.

#### **Metacation (Œ∫)**
A dual object to the Metanion (Œº). While the metanion is modeled topologically as a torus (an orientable buffer that recirculates energy neutrally across 256 states in ùîΩ‚ÇÇ‚Çà), the metacation is modeled as a M√∂bius strip (a non-orientable carrier with a single continuous boundary). In CE1, the metacation represents twist transport: it couples boundary policies with reversible orientation flips, serving as a charged mediator that can "hand off" state while changing its orientation. Conceptually, Œ∫ acts as the M√∂bius companion to Œº's torus, enabling non-orientable continuation in the VM's analytic and reversible kernels.

This transforms canonicalization from a technical procedure into an ecological law where fit is measured as distance from the critical line, and synergy emerges when seeds cooperate to reduce their collective distance-to-line.

#### **Critical Line Operator**
